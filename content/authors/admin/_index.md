I am currently a [Research Software Engineer - AI](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-Shubham.Agarwal) at [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Cambridge, MA](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/). My work has spanned from creating intelligent conversational agent platforms, declarative dialogue design and execution systems to a AAAI 2020 Best Technical Demo Award winning project called TraceHub for time-series analytics.

I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University in July 2017. During my master's degree I worked in the field of Natural Language Understanding and Semantic Parsing of English natural language. My thesis is titled - "[Aligning English Sentences with Abstract Meaning Representation Graphs using Inductive Logic Programming](https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/189619/content/Agarwal_asu_0010N_17209.pdf)".

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in the year 2015.
